# Security Best Practices for SlickAssess

This document outlines security best practices that should be followed when developing and maintaining the SlickAssess application.

## Environment Variables

- Never hardcode sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or tokens
- Always validate environment variables before using them
- Use the `validateEnvVar` utility from `lib/env-validator.ts`

## Authentication and Authorization

- Always check user authentication before accessing protected resources
- Verify tenant access for all tenant-specific operations
- Use the `requireTenantAccess` middleware from `convex/lib/authMiddleware.ts`

## Data Validation

- Validate all user inputs on both client and server sides
- Use the file validation utilities from `lib/fileValidation.ts`
- Define proper types for all data structures and avoid using `any`

## Error Handling

- Catch and handle errors appropriately
- Use structured error logging with the `trackError` utility
- Don't expose sensitive information in error messages to clients

## HTML and Content Security

- Always escape user-generated content when rendering HTML
- Use the email template utilities from `lib/emailTemplates.ts`
- Avoid inline script execution and follow Content Security Policy best practices

## API Security

- Rate limit API endpoints to prevent abuse
- Implement proper CORS policies
- Validate all API requests and responses

## File Storage

- Enforce tenant isolation for all stored files
- Validate file types and sizes before upload
- Use signed URLs with expiration for file access

## Regular Security Reviews

- Conduct regular security audits
- Keep dependencies updated
- Monitor for suspicious activities
